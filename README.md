### Built With

This project will be mainly written in React, together with these frameworks and libraries:

[![React][react.js]][react-url]
[![Supabase][Supabase]][Supabase-url]
[![MaterialUI][Material-ui]][Materialui-url]

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

To run this project you'll need to have nodejs installed on your computer. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

> - React requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Get latest npm version

- npm

  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

- yarn
  ```sh
  npm install -g yarn
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ArvidWedtstein/VehiclePortal.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your environment variables. I used supabase postgres for this project, so you'll need to create a supabase account and add the url and key to your .env file. You can also use a different database, but you'll need to change the database url in the api/prisma/schema.prisma file.
   ```sh
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<pass>@db.<project>.supabase.co:<port>/postgres
   ```
4. Check if everything is fine.
   ```sh
   yarn redwood check
   ```

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deploying

Deploying image to scaleway:

1. build the docker image
   ```sh
   docker build -t VehiclePortal .
   ```
2. pull docker image
   ```sh
   docker pull ubuntu:latest
   ```
3. tag the image
   ```sh
   docker tag VehiclePortal ArvidWedtstein/VehiclePortal:latest
   ```
4. push the image to docker hub
   ```sh
   docker push ArvidWedtstein/VehiclePortal:latest
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Project can be used to keep track of your services done on your vehicles

### Testing

It'd be hard to scale from side project to startup without a few tests.

Testing is not in place yet, but will hopefully come later

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- [x] Make a plan for the database schema
- [ ] Make a UI design in figma
- [ ] Decide on what framework / database to use
- [ ] Execute plan
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Find place to deploy (preferably free)

<!--https://redwoodjs.com/docs/how-to/test-in-github-actions-->

See the [open issues](https://github.com/ArvidWedtstein/VehiclePortal/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

<!--
Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.
